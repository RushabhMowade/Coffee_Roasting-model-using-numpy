# ***CoffeeRoasting_using_numpy***
I built a Coffee Roasting Prediction Model from scratch using NumPy, implementing my own dense layers, sequential model, and prediction function without relying on high-level ML libraries. The model takes temperature (°C) and roasting duration (minutes) as inputs to predict the probability of achieving a good roast, based on guidelines of 12–15 minutes and 175–260 °C. A 0.5 threshold is applied to the predicted probability to classify roasts as good or not.
